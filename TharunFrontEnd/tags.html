    <p><del>Perplexity</del> <ins>PERPLEXITY AI</ins> is a metric in information theory and machine learning that measures how well a probability model predicts a sample, 
        indicating the models uncertainty—the higher the perplexity,the more uncertain the predictions. 
         In natural language processing, it quantifies how “surprised” a language model is by new text, 
         with lower perplexity meaning the model is more confident and accurate 
         in predicting the next word.</p>
